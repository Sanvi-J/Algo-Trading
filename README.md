We started this course by first understanding some basics about stock market and finance. The mentors provided some reading material and videos to refer for the week 0. 

Stock Market:
Investment in Equities involves buying shares of publicly listed companies. The shares are traded on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE).
Investing in some of the best and most well-run Indian companies has yielded over 20% CAGR in the long term. Identifying such investment opportunities requires skill, hard work, and patience.
The stock market is an electronic marketplace. Buyers and sellers electronically express their points of view in terms of trade. 
A stock market is where market participants can access any publicly listed company and trade from their point of view as long as other participants have an opposing point of view. After all, different opinions are what make a market.
There are different types of traders :
Day Trader – A day trader initiates and closes the position during the day. He does not carry forward trading positions overnight. A day trader is risk-averse and does not like taking an overnight risk
Scalper – A type of day trader. A scalper usually trades very large shares and holds the stock for less time to make a small but quick profit. A scalp trader is highly risk-averse.
Swing Trader – A swing trader holds on to the trade for a slightly longer; the duration can run anywhere between a few days to weeks. 

Basic terminologies:
 Bull Market (Bullish) – If you expect the stock prices to go up, you are bullish on the stock price. From a broader perspective, if the stock market index is going up during a particular period, it is referred to as a bull market. 
 Bear Market (Bearish) – If you expect the stock prices to go down, you are bearish on the stock price. From a broader perspective, if the stock market index goes down during a particular period, it is referred to as a bear market.
 Trend – The term ‘trend’ usually refers to the general market direction and its associated momentum in the market. For example, if the market is declining fast, the trend is said to be bearish. If the market is trading flat with no movement, then the trend is said to be sideways.
 Face value of a stock – The face value (FV) or par value indicates the nominal value of a share. The face value is important from a corporate action perspectiveUsually, when dividends, stock splits, or bonuses are announced, they are issued, keeping the face value in perspective
 52-week high/low – 52-week high is the highest price point at which a stock has traded during the last 52 weeks (which also marks a full calendar year); likewise, a 52-week low marks the lowest price point at which the stock has traded during the last 52 weeks. The 52-week high and low gives a sense of the range within which the stock trades during the year. Many traders believe that if a stock price reaches 52 weeks high, it indicates a bullish trend for the foreseeable future. Similarly, if a stock hits 52 week low, some traders believe it indicates a bearish trend for the foreseeable future.
 All-time high/low – This is similar to the 52 weeks high and low, with the only difference being that the all-time high price is the highest price the stock had ever traded from when it was listed. Similarly, the all-time low price is the lowest price the stock had ever traded from when it was listed.
 Long Position – Long position or going long is a reference to the direction of your trade. If one plans to buy or intend to buy a company’s shares, they are long on that company or planning to go long respectively. 
 Short Position – Going short or ‘shorting’ is a term used to describe a transaction carried out in a particular order. It involves buying a share and then selling it later.
 
Japanese Candlesticks:
The candlestick, like a bar chart, is made of 3 components.
1.	The Central real body – The real body, rectangular, connects the opening and closing price.
2.	Upper shadow – Connects the high point to the close (in bullish candle and open in bearish).
3.	Lower Shadow – Connects the low point to the open (in bullish candle and close in bearish).
   
Indicators: 
1.	Mean reversion: Mean-reversion is the idea that prices tend to “bounce back” toward their historical average. They ‘revert’ back to their mean, hence the name.
When a stock runs unusually high or low relative to its historical mean, the trader bets that it will return closer to average. This works well for stocks that are bounded by some range and are not highly volatile.
2.	MM: Buy low, sell high and keep doing it, both at the same time! The simplest strategy is market-making or MM. The trader tries to earn the bid-ask spread by offering to buy at some price and selling at a slightly higher price. If they do a lot of these trades (think 1000s), the profit becomes significantly large. This strategy is effective only in highly liquid markets. While there may be some market makers in low liquidity markets, they have to widen their spreads to reduce risk.
3.	Bollinger bands: Bollinger bands are directly connected to mean reversion but not exclusively. They are a volatility-based technical indicator consisting of three lines plotted around a price chart. The middle band is usually a 20-day simple moving average (SMA), and the upper and lower bands are found by adding and subtracting two standard deviations from the middle band. Logic behind this indicator is that as volatility increases (standard deviation increases), the Bollinger bands expand and vice versa if volatility is low. These bands serve as thresholds for mean reversion, for example, when the price touches the upper band, it signals a potential reversal in trend and traders short. It is very important to note that the price touching the upper band is not a guarantee of trend reversal.
4.	RSI: RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes. It measures momentum by comparing average gain and average losses over a period (typically 14 days) to determine if the stock is overbought or oversold. RSI gives an output between 0 and 100. Where 0 indicates oversold conditions and 100 indicates overbought.
5.	Z-score: Z-score is an indicator of price extremes and can be used with mean reversion strategies. A positive z-score like 2 means that the price is running 2 standard deviations above the average price and may revert. A negative z-score is similar, price is running 2 standard deviations below the average and may revert. A z-score of 0 or close to 0 (like <0.3) means there are no significant price changes happening.
Using these strategies, we had to write codes for 3 imaginary stocks whose data was given. This was then run on a back-tester on unseen data and checked how well the strategies were used to reduce error and noise.
